"""LSA-FW Baseflow Solver.

This module provides the BaseFlowSolver class to compute the steady-state (base) flow solution of the incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations. Under the hood, it:

  - Assembles and solves a Stokes problem to generate a robust initial guess.
  - Optionally ramps the Reynolds number from 1.0 to the user-specified target over multiple steps to improve
  convergence.
  - Solves the stationary Navier-Stokes equations using Newton's method with an adjustable damping factor.
  - Can plot the resulting mixed velocity-pressure field for visualization.

The computed base flow can then be used as the background state for linear stability analyses or perturbation solvers.

Example:
```python
# Upstream: build mesh, define FunctionSpaces and BoundaryConditions...
solver = BaseFlowSolver(spaces, bcs)

# Compute base flow at Re = 100 with 5-step ramp and 0.8 damping, and show plot
baseflow = solver.solve(
    re=100.0,
    ramp=True,
    steps=5,
    damping_factor=0.8,
    show_plot=True,
)

# HACK: In theory, the dolfinx API should be sufficient to export/import function objects. However, up to now,
# writing or reading a mixed-function (e.g., a Taylorâ€“Hood mixed P2/P1) directly can lead to low-level crashes
# or mismatches because PETSc binary views and XDMF I/O expect a single continuous Lagrange field of matching
# polynomial degree. Mixed spaces must be split into their subcomponents (velocity and pressure), and even
# then the degree of the output must match the mesh degree to avoid I/O failures. As a workaround, we optionally
# interpolate the P2 velocity to a P1 vector space for safe export. Importing back into the original mixed
# space may still fail or lose fidelity if the exported data does not exactly match the mixed DOF layout.
